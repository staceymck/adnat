As a member of an organisation users can log their own work shifts as well as edit and delete shifts of other employees. Users can also view a list of all shifts at the organisation, including the following details about each shift:
* Employee name
* Shift date
* Shift overnight status
* Start time
* Finish time
* Break length (mins)
* Hours worked
* Shift cost

The list can be filtered by employee first or last name, and provides links for editing or deleting individual shift records.
